# Hatsugen

A small programming language being formally defined with a series of blog posts
and [Lean][1] code.

## Note about the Lean version

This uses Lean 3.4.2, even though the 'latest' version as of writing is Lean 4.
This is because the docs for Lean 4 seem even more scarce than the docs for Lean
3, and I couldn't figure out how to do some stuff. In general, although Lean 4
is clearly the future, it seems like it's not totally ready for prime time yet.
I'm excited for the future though!
